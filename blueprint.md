# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a Flutter application for student data analysis. The application will consist of two main pages: an upload page and an analysis page.

## Features

### Upload Page
- A button to upload Excel files.
- A preview icon to show the uploaded file.
- An "Analyze" button to navigate to the analysis page.

### Analysis Page
- A table to display the data from the uploaded Excel file.
- A search box at the top of the page to filter the data.

## Design
- The application will use a colorful and modern design.
- Animations will be used to enhance the user experience.

## Plan

1. **Add Dependencies:** Add `go_router` for navigation and `file_picker` for file selection to `pubspec.yaml`.
2. **Create Upload Page:** Create a new file `lib/upload_page.dart` that contains the UI for uploading files.
3. **Create Analysis Page:** Create a new file `lib/analysis_page.dart` that contains the UI for displaying the analysis.
4. **Set up Routing:** Modify `lib/main.dart` to use `go_router` to manage navigation between the upload and analysis pages.
5. **Implement UI:** Design and implement a visually appealing and user-friendly interface with animations.
6. **Format Code:** Ensure the code is well-formatted and follows Dart best practices.
